In this code:

We import the java.util.Scanner class to read the user's input.
We create a Scanner object called scanner to read from the standard input (System.in).
We prompt the user to enter two numbers using System.out.print, and then use scanner.nextInt() to read the input as integers.
We calculate the sum of the two numbers and print it to the console.
Finally, we close the Scanner object to prevent resource leaks.
Note: This code assumes that the user will enter valid integer values. If the user enters something other than an integer, the program will throw an InputMismatchException. You may want to add error handling to handle such cases.
